Advanced:
  Compress file data --compress
  Don't map uid/gid values --numeric-ids
  Copy hardlinks as hardlinks --hard-links
  Protect remote args --protect-args
              ? is this require, as script quotes args?

Extra:
  Execute command before rsync: [......] Halt on failure [x]
  Execute command afger rsync: [.....] On rsync error only [x]
  Run as root (use pkexec to call carbon-runner)
  -- will also need to use pkexec to call carbon-terminate
  -- need to set owner of lock, log, and info files.
    -- perhaps pass --owner=UID --group=GID to carbon-runner ?
       script then needs to create lock, log, info first,
       and then set ownership. This way if crash we are safe!
